# Swim-Stroke-Recognition-AI-Model

It was prepared for the final project of Ya≈üar University AIE 5501 course code. An artificial intelligence image recognition model that predicts swimming branches using supervised learning technique from image classes of 4 swimming branches.

The model, which takes an image as input, gives us a result by modeling artificial neural networks. The output layer consists of 4 cells, these are 4 swimming branches.


The final result was an accuracy rate of around 70% at best.
